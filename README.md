# hcgo

> A go implementation of <https://github.com/hoop33/hc>

## Overview

I built this for a "Getting Started with Go" presentation, and it's currently woefully incomplete. I plan to grow it to match the Objective-C version at the above URL.

## Installation

Make sure you have a working Go installation, and then run:

```
$ go get -u github.com/hoop33/hcgo
```

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome and encouraged!
